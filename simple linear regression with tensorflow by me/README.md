<h1>Linear Regression</h1>

Welcome Hear I have uploaded simple tensorflow code which will simply create hypothesis on our traning datasets.
![Example](https://github.com/jimmyahalpara/Tensorflow-Projects/blob/master/simple%20linear%20regression%20with%20tensorflow%20by%20me/Capture.PNG

It dosen't use any large data sets but it just creates some points using **numpy** such that is forms line with some errors but not scatter away increasing the cost and making our model and prediction fail.
