<h1>Linear Regression</h1>

Welcome Hear I have uploaded simple tensorflow code which will simply create hypothesis on our traning datasets.
![Example](https://github.com/jimmyahalpara/Tensorflow-Projects/blob/master/simple%20linear%20regression%20with%20tensorflow%20by%20me/Capture.PNG)

It dosen't use any large data sets but it just creates some points using **numpy** such that is forms line with some errors but not scatter away increasing the cost and making our model and prediction fail.
It is fairly simple model with small training sets but as a beginner its really an achivement.
