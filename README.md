# **Machine Learning and Deep Learning**
## My Work 
* [Handwritten Digits Classification Using Deep Neural Network](https://github.com/jimmyahalpara/Machine-and-Deep-Learning/tree/master/Handwriting%20Classification%20using%20Deep%20Neural%20Network)
	* Implemented Deep Neural Network from previous project **Cat Classification Using Deep Neural Network**
	* Modified Input and Output layer size
	* Used **MNIST** dataset
	* Added Feature to Save trained model and retrain same model
	* Used modules **Numpy, Matplotlib, Scipy, PIL, pickle, Skimage**
* [Cat Classification Using Deep Neural Network](https://github.com/jimmyahalpara/Machine-and-Deep-Learning/tree/master/Cat%20Classification%20with%20Deep%20Neural%20Network)
	* Implemented Neural Network with Multiple Layers
	* Added feature for saving our trained model
	* Can predict from images provided from user
	* Created by doing some modification in deeplearning.ai assignment
	* Used modules **Numpy, Scipy, Matplotlib, PIL, pickle**
* [Classification with Shallow Neural Network](https://github.com/jimmyahalpara/Machine-and-Deep-Learning/tree/master/Classification%20using%20Shallow%20Neural%20Network)
	* Implemented Neural network with one Hidden Layer
	* Trained using dataset from **sklearn**
	* Compared Accuracy against different **Datasets**, **No. of Hidden Layer Neurons**
	* Used modules **Sklearn, Matplotlib, Numpy**
* [Logistic Regression - Cat Classification](https://github.com/jimmyahalpara/Machine-and-Deep-Learning/tree/master/Cat%20Classification%20with%20Logistic%20Regression)
	* Made by keeping neural network in mind.
	* Compared accuracy for different **Learning Rate** and **No of Iterations**
	* created by doing some modification in my Deeplearning.ai programming assignment
	* Used modules **Numpy, Matplotlib, Scipy, Skimage, Pickle, PIL**
* [Linear Regression with Tensorflow](https://github.com/jimmyahalpara/Machine-and-Deep-Learning/tree/master/simple%20linear%20regression%20with%20tensorflow%20by%20me)
	* Used Tensorflow
	* Used Gradient Descent for optimization
	* Random Dataset created using Numpy
	* Used modules **Tensorflow**,**Numpy** and **Matplotlib**. 


Here I'll be posting my work as I learn and make.
