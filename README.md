Here I'll be posting my tensorflow codes as I start Learning them
<h1>1.  My first program of linear regression</h1> 

My first program of linear regression was just plotting the hypothesis on the datasets randomly created using **numpy** and plotted using **matplotlib** in **python** and model trainded by **tensorflow** using **gradient descent algorithem**.

<h2> How linear regression and gradient descent works </h2>

Let's say you have three points with following positions

We want to make prediction on this we wan't a line that traces all the points and to the prediction will be easy in the future.
But we need the line such that it passes all the points roughly or maybe we can minimize the error between the point and line that will make our line approximatly pass over our points.
Lets say in this diagram the distance between two points on X any Y axis represent one unit distance.
Tracing the points perfectly we get the following line that we want from regression.
