# Cat Classification using Deep Neural Network

Following program for Deep Neural network is made from deeplearning.ai Specialization course 1 Assignment. I have added some extra features for custamizing our network and saving our model. Hope you enjoy.

# Usage

When you start the Main program.py, you have to select some pre-trained model or train new one by selecting Option 1 and 2. I you train new model it gets saved in current directroy with **.mod** extenison.

## Modules used

* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Scipy
* PIL
* Pickel

## Contents

* **Main Program.py** - Main file
* **dnn_utils_v2** - provides some useful functions for neural network.
