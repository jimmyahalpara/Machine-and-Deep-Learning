# Cat Classification using Deep Neural Network

Following program for Deep Neural network is made from deeplearning.ai Specialization course 1 Assignment. I have added some extra features for custamizing our network and saving our model. Hope you enjoy.

## Modules used

* Numpy
* Matplotlib
* Scipy
* PIL
* Pickel

## Contents

* Main Program.py - Main file
* dnn_utils_v2 - provides some useful functions for neural network.
