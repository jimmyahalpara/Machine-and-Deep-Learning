# Classifying Cats with Logistic regression

This is Deeplearning.ai assignment. Here logistic regression is done keeping Neural Network in mind. I have done some modificatin so that we can save the model that we have trained.

## Accuracy Analysis

Bellow is the Accuracy analysis for three different values of learning rate and no of iterations =  15000
![Result](result.png)

|Learning Rate|Train Accuracy|Test Accuracy|
|-------------|-----|----|
| 0.02        |100% |68.0%|
| 0.001|     99.52153110047847 %|72.0 %|
|0.0001|88.99521531100478 %|64.0 %|
